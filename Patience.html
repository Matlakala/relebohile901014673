	<p>
		We all need each other. Being patient with other people just<br>
		allows them a chance to see they can make things happen too; give<br>
		 them a reason to feel the need to go on, as they should. Many of<br>
		 the things people do affect others. It would only be nice to try<br>
		 to be accomodating to everyone despite their differences.<br>

		in my point ther is really no good in not trying to help other<br>
		people, and in an idirect way its what most people live to do.<br>
		for instance, take a look at people's daily jobs. it is almost<br>
		all disguised in doing it for money, but the underlying cause remains-<br>
		people.
