	<p>
		You may know me different, but they say you are what you think (of yourself mostly).<br>
		I like to think of myself as a real force.Let me tell you how; not everyone wants<br>
		to admit that being a good person is what we'd all want see in our lives someday.<br>
		I spend my time, directing my energy to things that make me better in everyway because<br>
		in my life i would like to be known as a person of purpose, even after time.
