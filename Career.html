		Growing as a boy here in Lesotho is basically steriotypical, in fact, for<br>
		every Mosotho child. Establishing a different career choice other than through<br>
		school is almost mystrical. My career path is no different from every other<br>
		child's growing up in Lesotho.<br><br>

	<p>
		I have gone to elementry, middle school, high school and to where i am<br>
		now-varsity.The road has been pretty tough getting here but like any<br>
		purposeful person i have rode my way here and i take pride in every step<br>
		it took to get here
