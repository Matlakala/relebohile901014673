	<p>
		Being young thse days is about exploring and for me desiring<br>
		to know many things and actually partaking in then helps me<br>
		have a wide range of hobbies, and possibly oppotunities.<br><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		having hobbies is fun.for me is putting myself out there,<br>
		letting myself try out new that other people do and actually<br>
		attempt to establish a career.at some point they intersect and<br>
		a few times i have earned some pennies over "hobbies".
